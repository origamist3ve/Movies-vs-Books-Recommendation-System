# Movies-vs-Books-Recommendation-System
The original movie notebook was found on kaggle through the Netflix competition and its dataset.
The movie noteboook was used with the book dataset after it was cleaned to fit the format of the dataset provided with the movie notebook.
The purpose of this project was to test if the accuracy when recommending books would be as similar as when recommending movies when using the same code format for both.
